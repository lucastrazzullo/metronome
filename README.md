# Haptic Metronome

Haptic Metronome is a visual/haptic first digital metronome.
It pulses beats with both a visual reference and a haptic feedback pattern.
You can optionally switch on/off the audio.

You can change the settings with one-gesture actions, while you keep focussing on your song or practice exercise. Or use the panel control on the bottom of the screen.

Slide up/down with two fingers on the screen to adjust the bpm. Pinch in/out with two fingers anywhere on the screen to adjust the note length. You can toggle on/off by just tapping on the screen with one finger and few other gestures that wait for you to try them.

You won't need to learn the gestures all at once. At any time, you can pull up the "tips" screen, which shows you all the gestures you can use on the metronome to set it up.

Your brain will do the rest, you'll get used to these gestures before you even imagine.


Enjoy your playing!
